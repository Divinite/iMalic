-- Current download:
	Should take up whole screen and create a .lock file to stop more packages being added. 

-- Search feature:
	Simple, easy (ls /folder | grep $search) with some shellescapeexe.

-- Backup feature:
	Back up list of packages to a folder, with date. Allow for it to be restored if there are accidents.
