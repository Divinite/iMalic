*** Ideas brainstromed for implmentation on the client side (with possible server side data needed which is noted) ***

-- Current download pop up (located as a thin black bar on the bottom of the app)
	Data needed: package name, percent done (total downloaded / download size), time remaining ([download_size - total_download) / download_rate (mb/s)])
	Will be displayed as: Current_Package: X% done, Xmin remaining

-- AJAX powered search feature (similar to google's autcomplete search)
	Data needed: C0deH4CK3R to help program the search (i don't know how to in python, but i do in php)

-- Download stats for iNinjas Repo apps only
	Data needed: again, a python programmer. need to be able to determine if it's an ininjas app and store the download stats in a XML file for easy parsing. Man i gotta learn python for this project) ;)
-- different categories hacktools,themes,tweaks, etc.(Modder67)
-- iphone dock and icons as nav bar.(Modder67)
